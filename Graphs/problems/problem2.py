# Finding the Actual Shortest Path
# This builds on your previous solution and helps you understand how BFS keeps track of the path as it explores the graph.

# Goal:
# Instead of just returning the number of steps, weâ€™ll return the full shortest path from source to destination.


# A-----------B----------D
# |                     *|
# |                   *  |

# |               *      |   
# |             *        | 
# C-----------E----------F

# A => F: [[A,B,D,F], [A,C,E,F]]
# A => B: [[A, B], [A,C,E,D,B], [A,C,E,F,D,B]]
