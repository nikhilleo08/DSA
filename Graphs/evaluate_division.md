# 399. Evaluate Division

[399. Evaluate Division](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-division/)

Few things to be clear before starting:

1.  If  `x / y`  is asked and either  `x`  or  `y`  are not in  `equations`, we return -1, even if it is  `x / x`.
2.  In Example 2,  `"bc"`  is a single variable, it is  **NOT**  `b * c`. Treat every string  `equations[i][j]`  as an atomic variable, not a product of some.

# Hint 1

One thing that you might have thought is that if we are given  a/b=n1​  and  b/c=n2​, then we can calculate  a/c  as  (a/b)∗(b/c)=n1​n2​. We can multiply or divide few given equations to cancel out some variables and generate new equations.  
Let's remove the option to divide by rearranging the equations in the form  a=n1​b  and  b=n2​c. How can we generate  a  in terms of  c  now?

# Hint 2

To write  a  in terms of  c, let's start with  a=n1​b. Put the value of  b  from  b=n2​c. New equation will be  a=n1​(n2​c)=n1​n2​c=n3​c, where  n3​=n1​n2​  is the answer for  a/c.  
So, if we want to generate some variable  x  in terms of some other variable  y, then we need some set of equations of the form  
x=n1​x1​  
x1​=n2​x2​  
x2​=n3​x3​  
.  
.  
.  
xk​=nk+1​y  
Using these equations we can start from  x  and reach  y  because there exists a  **path**  of variables  [x1​,x2​,...,xk​]  between them.  
And the final answer would become the product  n1​n2​n3​...nk+1​.

# Hint 3

To get a path from  x  to  y, we need to keep track of every equation of the form  x=ni​xi​  which starts with  x  and goes to some other variables  xi​. We need this information for every given variable so that we can check if some variables put together will form a path or not.  
To do this, we can put them in a graph where each vertex will denote a variable and each edge will denote a relation of variables for equations  a=nb.  
For example, if  a=2b  then graph will be

Will this graph be directed or undirected? If  a=2b  then is  b=2a?

# Hint 4

We need to make a directed graph for equations  a=nb. But what if we want to calculate  b  in terms of  a? If  a=nb  is an equation, then  b=(1/n)a  is also another equation by which we can get  b  in terms of  a.  
For example, if  a=2b, then graph will have 2 directed edges as

# Hint 5

Let's make graph for Example 2:

```sql
equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"],["bc","cd"]]
values    = [ 1.5,      2.5,      5.0]
```

The equations are  a=1.5b,  b=2.5c,  bc=5.0cd. (bc  is just another different variable it is  **NOT**  equal to  b∗c)  
The graph will be:

Now, calculate for given queries

```javascript
queries = [["a","c"],["c","b"],["bc","cd"],["cd","bc"]]
```

1.  Calculate  a  in terms of  c  as  a=1.5b=1.5(2.5c)=3.75c
2.  Calculate  c  in terms of  b  as  c=0.4b
3.  Calculate  bc  in terms of  cd  as  bc=5cd
4.  Calculate  cd  in terms of  bc  as  cd=0.2bc

# Hint 6

Can we calculate  a  in terms of  bc? No, there is no path of variables between them.  
Calculating some variable  x  in terms of some other variable  y  is same as finding a valid path between  x  and  y, where the final answer of  x/y  will be the product of weights of edges  ni​'s that are present in the path.

# Hint 7

Make the graph. For every equation  a=nb, add two edges  `a --n--> b`  and  `a <--1/n-- b`.  
For each query  [c,d], check if such nodes even exists in the graph or not. If they don't even exist, there is no path, return  `-1`  (Like in Example 1,  `x`  does not exists so return  `-1`  even if we just wanted  `x / x`).  
If both  c  and  d  exists in the graph, traverse the graph to get a path between them, maintaining cost of path as product of weights of edges traversed. If path is found return the product, and if not, then  `-1`.
